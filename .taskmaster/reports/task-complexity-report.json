		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Basic App Shell with Header and Routing",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the foundational setup into discrete components: Nuxt.js project initialization, @nuxt/ui module configuration, header component creation, and routing setup. Each subtask should be independently testable.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task with standard Nuxt.js setup. While it involves multiple components (project setup, UI library integration, routing), these are well-documented patterns with minimal technical complexity. The main effort is in proper configuration and ensuring all pieces work together."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "XML Parser Composable with Interactive Demo",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the XML parsing logic from the UI demo: create TypeScript interfaces, implement core parsing functions, add validation logic, build the debug interface, and integrate with sample data. Focus on robust error handling for XML parsing edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to XML parsing with DOMParser API, TypeScript interface design, and error handling. The interactive demo adds UI complexity, but the core parsing logic is straightforward. Main challenges are handling malformed XML and creating a robust validation system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Template System with Modern Template Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into template architecture design, composable creation, Modern template component implementation, comprehensive styling system, debug page creation, and integration testing. Ensure the template system is extensible for future templates.",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to creating an extensible template system architecture. Involves component design, CSS styling system, and ensuring proper data flow. The template must be flexible enough for future extensions while maintaining clean separation of concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Monaco XML Editor Component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into Monaco editor dependency setup, wrapper component creation with v-model implementation, XML syntax highlighting configuration, and debug page integration. Focus on proper event handling and editor configuration.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving third-party library integration (Monaco editor). The main challenges are proper v-model implementation, XML syntax highlighting setup, and ensuring the editor integrates well with Vue's reactivity system. Well-documented library reduces complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Preview Panel Component with Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into preview component structure, XML parsing integration, template rendering logic, comprehensive error handling implementation, and debug page with test cases. Emphasize robust error states and user feedback.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to integration of multiple systems (parser, templates) with robust error handling. The component must gracefully handle various error states while providing good user feedback. Zoom functionality adds additional complexity to the rendering logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Dual-Panel Integration with Real-Time Updates",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into layout implementation, component integration, real-time update system with debouncing, sample data loading, header updates, and responsive design testing. Focus on smooth user experience and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity as this integrates multiple previous components into a cohesive application. Real-time updates with debouncing, responsive layout, and ensuring smooth performance across different content types adds significant complexity. This is a critical integration point."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "HTML Export Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into export composable creation, HTML extraction logic, CSS processing and embedding, file download implementation, and UI integration. Focus on generating clean, standalone HTML files with proper CSS isolation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to DOM manipulation, CSS extraction, and file generation. The challenge is extracting only relevant styles while excluding framework-specific CSS, generating valid standalone HTML, and handling different browser download behaviors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Editor Actions (Format, Clear, Import)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into XML formatting logic, clear functionality with confirmation, file import system, error handling for each action, UI integration, and comprehensive testing. Ensure each action provides appropriate user feedback.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving multiple distinct features. XML formatting requires parsing and prettifying logic, file import needs validation and error handling, and the confirmation modal adds UI complexity. Each feature is relatively straightforward but requires proper integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Preview Zoom Controls",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into zoom control UI implementation, zoom state management, preview scaling logic, and optional localStorage persistence. Focus on smooth scaling transitions and maintaining layout integrity.",
			"reasoning": "Lower complexity as it's primarily UI enhancement. The main challenges are CSS transforms for scaling and state management. localStorage persistence is optional and straightforward. The feature is well-contained with minimal dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Panel Resizing with Draggable Divider",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into splitpanes library integration, drag handle implementation, minimum width constraints, and optional persistence. Focus on smooth resizing behavior and proper Monaco editor resize handling.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to drag interactions and layout constraints. Using a library like splitpanes reduces complexity, but ensuring Monaco editor resizes properly and maintaining minimum widths adds some challenge. The feature is well-contained."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Additional Templates (Classic & Minimal)",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into Classic template creation, Minimal template creation, template system updates, debug page enhancements, and documentation updates. Ensure each template demonstrates different layout approaches while maintaining consistency.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as it extends the existing template system. The main work is creating new template variations and updating the selection system. Since the architecture exists, this is primarily implementation work with some system integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Accessibility & Cross-Browser Polish",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into keyboard navigation implementation, ARIA labels and screen reader support, WCAG compliance testing and fixes, cross-browser compatibility testing, performance optimization, focus management, color contrast validation, and comprehensive accessibility testing. This requires systematic testing across multiple dimensions.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the comprehensive nature of accessibility and cross-browser work. Requires testing across multiple browsers, implementing proper ARIA support, ensuring WCAG compliance, and performance optimization. This is quality assurance work that touches every part of the application and requires specialized knowledge."
